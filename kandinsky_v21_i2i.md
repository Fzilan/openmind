# Kandinsky 2.1 Image-to-image

The Kandinsky models are a series of multilingual text-to-image generation models. The Kandinsky 2.0 model uses two multilingual text encoders and concatenates those results for the UNet.

[Kandinsky 2.1](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2) changes the architecture to include an image prior model ([`CLIP`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clip)) to generate a mapping between text and image embeddings. The mapping provides better text-image alignment and it is used with the text embeddings during training, leading to higher quality results. Finally, Kandinsky 2.1 uses a [Modulating Quantized Vectors (MoVQ)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2209.09002) decoder - which adds a spatial conditional normalization layer to increase photorealism - to decode latents into images.

To use the Kandinsky models for any task, you always start by setting up the prior pipeline to encode the prompt and generate the image embeddings. The prior pipeline also generates `negative_image_embeds` that correspond to the negative prompt `""`. For better results, you can pass an actual `negative_prompt` to the prior pipeline, but that'll increase the effective batch size of the prior pipeline by 2x.

For Kandinsky 2.1 image-to-image tasks in mindone.diffusers, pass the initial image and text prompt to condition the image to the pipeline. Start by loading the prior pipeline:

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import KandinskyImg2ImgPipeline, KandinskyPriorPipeline

prior_pipeline = KandinskyPriorPipeline.from_pretrained("kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-1-prior", mindspore_dtype=ms.float16, use_safetensors=True)
pipeline = KandinskyImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained("kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-1", mindspore_dtype=ms.float16, use_safetensors=True)
```

Download an image to condition on:

```py
from mindone.diffusers.utils import load_image

# download image
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/assets/stable-samples/img2img/sketch-mountains-input.jpg"
original_image = load_image(url)
original_image = original_image.resize((768, 512))
```

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start; text-align: center; max-width: 98%; margin: 0 auto; gap: 1vw;">
    <img class="rounded-xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/assets/stable-samples/img2img/sketch-mountains-input.jpg"/>
</div>

Generate the `image_embeds` and `negative_image_embeds` with the prior pipeline:

```py
prompt = "A fantasy landscape, Cinematic lighting"
negative_prompt = "low quality, bad quality"

image_embeds, negative_image_embeds = prior_pipeline(prompt, negative_prompt)
```

Now pass the original image, and all the prompts and embeddings to the pipeline to generate an image:

```python
from mindone.diffusers.utils import make_image_grid

image = pipeline(prompt, negative_prompt=negative_prompt, image=original_image, image_embeds=image_embeds, negative_image_embeds=negative_image_embeds, height=768, width=768, strength=0.3)[0][0]
make_image_grid([original_image.resize((512, 512)), image.resize((512, 512))], rows=1, cols=2)
```


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start; text-align: center; max-width: 98%; margin: 0 auto; gap: 1vw;">
    <img class="rounded-xl" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ab742d0-1dcd-449c-883c-215f80fdc9e1"/>
</div>
